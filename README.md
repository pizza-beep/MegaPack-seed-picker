# Megapack Seed Picker
https://pizza-beep.github.io/MegaPack-seed-picker/

This is a simple website to get a seed for the Minecraft 3ds [MegaPack](https://github.com/wyndchyme/mc3ds-modern)

The seed will include village and a pillager outpost.
Due to how the MegaPack works, this seed will be guaranteed to have a snowy biome.

## NOTE
This does not generate seeds locally, it picks seeds from mutiple seeds from a huge list I compiled using advanced software.
